# Foreword by Chris Rowen {.unnumbered}

If you’ve been living under a rock for the past five years, you might have missed the explosion of interest in artificial intelligence (AI). Otherwise, you’ve probably felt the buzz in the media, seen the flood of new products, and noticed the astonishing pace of technical progress in AI. But the complexity of these methods, the breadth of their applications, and the breathless hype may leave you yearning for thoughtful yet accessible explanations. The AI Forge is here to provide exactly that kind of grounding and to help you explore many of the most important questions:

- Where did AI come from?
- What kinds of problems can AI methods solve?
- What does AI progress reveal about the nature of intelligence?
- How can you internalize—and truly understand—the remarkable power (and occasional weaknesses) of AI?

Dr. Jianxian Wu’s book makes remarkably lucid progress on these questions, while offering a systematic journey through puzzles, games, and algorithms that enable you to learn AI by doing. Dr. Wu brings the ideal background to this task. His long career in high performance computing - spanning Teradyne, HP Labs, AMD, and Baidu, plus his own brave startup - led him naturally into the heart of advanced AI research, especially at the intersection of novel algorithms and scalable, efficient implementation. His rare combination of deep technical skill and educational clarity makes this book stand out as both authoritative and approachable. That experience shines through in this book, which combines practical insight with clear and structured explanations of core AI principles.

You’ll find The AI Forge weaving together four perspectives. First, it frames the evolution of AI through the stories of the pioneers who made breakthroughs in theory and practice. Second, it deepens that story with clear discussions of the foundational ideas—from the conceptual work of Alan Turing and Claude Shannon to the cutting-edge reasoning models of OpenAI and DeepSeek. Third, it grounds your learning in real examples, especially a deep exploration of the game Connect 4. This deceptively simple game serves as the backdrop for building up increasingly sophisticated AI strategies, from tree search, linear regression, and convolutional neural networks, to generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), reinforcement learning, and chat-oriented large language models. And finally, the book brings computing efficiency—often overlooked but critical—into sharp focus. By engaging with implementation challenges, you’ll learn how to build AI that is not only powerful, but also fast, efficient, scalable, and responsible. Along the way, you’ll gain not only technical understanding but also a deeper appreciation of AI’s potential to augment human insight and creativity.

Whether you're skimming through chapters of interest or diving deeply into the hands-on coding exercises and gameplay strategies, you'll find this book both accessible and rewarding. The AI Forge is a rare kind of resource: one that gives you a meaningful return on the time you invest, whether you spend two hours or two months with it.
